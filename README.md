Scraping Data from a Real Website + pandas

Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to scrape data from a real website using BeautifulSoup and process it with pandas. The script extracts information from a webpage, parses it,
and organizes it into a structured format for data analysis.

Project Files

Scraping Data from a Real Website + pandas.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for web scraping and data analysis.

Requirements

To run the project, you will need the following Python packages:

beautifulsoup4: For web scraping.

requests: To make HTTP requests to the website.

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

You can install the required packages by running: pip install beautifulsoup4 requests pandas

Instructions

Set up Python environment:

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

Install the required packages listed above.

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open the notebook file Scraping Data from a Real Website + pandas.ipynb.

Run the cells step by step to execute the code.

Customize the Script:

You can customize the target URL and modify the scraping logic to extract different information from the website.

After scraping, the data is processed using pandas, allowing you to explore or export the results in different formats (CSV, Excel, etc.).

Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of what the notebook does:

Scrape Web Data: Uses requests and BeautifulSoup to fetch and parse HTML data from a webpage.

Data Processing with pandas: The scraped data is structured into a pandas DataFrame, which allows easy manipulation, analysis, and export to various formats like CSV.

Example of loading and analyzing the data: import pandas as pd
# Assuming the scraped data is stored in a pandas DataFrame named df
print(df.head())
